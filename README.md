# Beevir
Collection of JP books, Rcode & circos configuration files for the prokaryotic viruses associated with bees.

Raw fasta files are available at:

 * 2Stats/data/Putativephage_DNARNA.fna (nucleotide)
 * 2Stats/data/Putativephage_DNARNA.faa (proteins, prodigal predicted)

## 1. Sample sharing

Creates sample / contig sharing networks from coverage / count data.

## 2. Stats

Basic genome statistics, Host calling information, dimension reduction (PHATE/PCoA).

## 3. Vcontact

Output processing of vConTACT2, taxonomy parsing, phylogenetic distances, and network distances.

## 4. Proteins

Protein annotation information, protein statistics (coding density & strandshift), selection statistics parsing.

## 5. Contig renaming

Incorporates information on classification, host, genome constellation and length together for contig renaming.

## Circos

Circos code for genome const. secondary metabolites gene clusters.

## R_Code

R scripts used for some plots.
